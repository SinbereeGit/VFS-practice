# Virtual File System

> Notes: This file is generated by *Copilot* based the projects ðŸ˜„.

This project provides a virtual file system that supports *serial multi-user* and *deduplication storage*. It is uniquely determined by a (special file set directory, specified user ID).

## Features

- **Serial Multi-User Support**: Allows multiple users to use the system serially.
- **Deduplication Storage**: Ensures that duplicate files are stored only once.
- **Virtual File System**: Provides a virtual file system with various operations.

## Usage

### Example

Using `with` statement:

```python
with VirtualFileSystem("root_dir", "user_id") as vfs:
    # Print the content of the current directory
    vfs.get_dir_content("")
    # Change to a specific directory
    vfs.chdir("dir_name")
    # Perform other operations...
```

Using `try` statement:

```python
try:
    vfs = VirtualFileSystem("root_dir", "user_id")
    # Print the content of the current directory
    vfs.get_dir_content("")
    # Change to a specific directory
    vfs.chdir("dir_name")
    # Perform other operations...
except Exception as e:
    # Handle exceptions
finally:
    vfs.store_change()
```

## Warnings

- All contents of the root directory must be generated by this module.
- Only one system instance can run at the same time for the same root directory (no concurrent support).
- Do not use the instance after calling `store_change` as its resources have been released.
- Internal path names currently have no strict naming restrictions.

## Notes

- Initialization details are in the `__init__` docstring.
- If not using `with`, use `try` and call `self.store_change` in `finally`.
- No parallel support.
- Supports Unix/Linux, Windows, and should support MacOS.
- Internal file paths use Unix format, external paths are OS-specific.
- File operations are non-overwriting.
- The directory structure is as follows:

  ```txt
  Root Directory
  â”œâ”€â”€ Reference Count File
  â”œâ”€â”€ Entity Files Directory
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Hash File 1
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Hash File 2
  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
  â””â”€â”€ User Space Directory
      â”œâ”€â”€ User Directory 1
      â”‚   â””â”€â”€ User Directory Tree File
      â”œâ”€â”€ User Directory 2
      â”‚   â””â”€â”€ User Directory Tree File
      â””â”€â”€ ...
  ```
